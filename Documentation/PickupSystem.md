# Unified Pickup System

The Unified Pickup System provides a consistent architecture for all pickup types in the game. All pickups inherit from `BasePickup` and handle their own collection logic, eliminating the need for controllers to manage pickup detection.

## Architecture Overview

### BasePickup Class
- **Location**: `Assets/Scripts/Pickups/BasePickup.cs`
- **Purpose**: Abstract base class that provides common pickup functionality
- **Key Features**:
  - Automatic collider setup and enabling
  - Generic trigger handling via `PickupTrigger` component
  - Abstract `OnPickupCollected` method for derived classes
  - Configurable pickup tag (default: "Player")
  - Active/inactive state management
  - Support for multiple colliders (dual collider setup for Push mode)

### PickupTrigger Component
- **Location**: `Assets/Scripts/Pickups/BasePickup.cs` (nested class)
- **Purpose**: Generic trigger handler that works with any `BasePickup`
- **Key Features**:
  - Automatically added to all colliders on pickup GameObjects
  - Forwards trigger events to the pickup's `HandlePickup` method
  - No need for custom trigger handling in derived classes

## Pickup Types

### CountPickup
- **Location**: `Assets/Scripts/Pickups/CountPickup.cs`
- **Purpose**: Handles regular count-based pickups for level completion
- **Key Features**:
  - Integrates with `CountManager` for level completion tracking
  - Automatically tags objects as "Pick Up" for CountManager detection
  - Configurable destruction on pickup
  - Can work with or without CountManager
  - Supports both Collect mode (player collection) and Push mode (goal collection)

### LifePickup
- **Location**: `Assets/Scripts/Pickups/LifePickup.cs`
- **Purpose**: Provides +1 life pickups with respawn timer
- **Key Features**:
  - Inherits from `BasePickup`
  - Respawn timer using real clock time (prevents scene reload exploits)
  - Player material matching and translucent material creation
  - Integration with `LivesManager`
  - Persistent storage using PlayerPrefs
  - Dynamic countdown display (hours:minutes:seconds or minutes:seconds)
  - Child object management (Pickup Sphere and Respawn Timer)

## Game Modes

### Collect Mode
- **Pickup Tag**: `"Player"`
- **Collection Method**: Player touches pickup
- **Collider Setup**: Single trigger collider
- **Usage**: Player moves around collecting pickups

### Push Mode
- **Pickup Tag**: `"Goal"`
- **Collection Method**: Puck hits goal
- **Collider Setup**: Dual colliders
  - **Physical collider**: For player pushing (physics forces)
  - **Trigger collider**: For goal detection
- **Usage**: Player pushes pucks toward goal

## Available Prefabs

### CountPickup Prefabs
- **Pick Up.prefab**: For Collect mode (single trigger collider)
- **Push.prefab**: For Push mode (dual colliders + Rigidbody)

### LifePickup Prefab
- **Life Pickup.prefab**: Complete life pickup with respawn system

## Setup Instructions

### Collect Mode Setup
1. **Use Pick Up.prefab** from `Assets/Resources/Prefabs/`
2. **Set pickupTag = "Player"** in CountPickup component
3. **Tag the pickup as "Pick Up"** (done automatically by CountPickup)

### Push Mode Setup
1. **Use Push.prefab** from `Assets/Resources/Prefabs/`
2. **Set pickupTag = "Goal"** in CountPickup component
3. **Ensure Goal object is tagged as "Goal"**

### Life Pickup Setup
1. **Use Life Pickup.prefab** from `Assets/Resources/Prefabs/`
2. **No additional setup required** - works out of the box

## Benefits

1. **Consistency**: All pickups follow the same architecture
2. **Separation of Concerns**: Pickups handle their own logic
3. **Extensibility**: Easy to create new pickup types
4. **Maintainability**: Centralized pickup handling
5. **Performance**: No need for controllers to check for pickups
6. **Flexibility**: Each pickup type can have custom behavior
7. **Dual Collider Support**: Push mode pucks can be pushed AND detected by goals
8. **Automatic Setup**: Minimal configuration required

## Debug Commands

- **Reset Life Pickup**: Right-click LifePickup component â†’ Reset Pickup
- **Console Logs**: Check Unity console for detailed debug information
- **Inspector**: Verify all component settings in inspector

## Best Practices

### Performance
- **Limit Pickup Count**: Don't place excessive numbers of pickups
- **Efficient Colliders**: Use appropriate collider types and sizes
- **Material Management**: Life pickups create translucent materials efficiently

### Design
- **Consistent Placement**: Use pickups to reward exploration or difficult challenges
- **Visual Feedback**: Make pickups noticeable and clear in purpose
- **Respawn Timing**: Consider respawn time relative to level completion time

### Code
- **Inherit from BasePickup**: For all new pickup types
- **Use Abstract Methods**: Override `OnPickupCollected` for custom behavior
- **Tag Management**: Let CountPickup handle "Pick Up" tagging automatically
